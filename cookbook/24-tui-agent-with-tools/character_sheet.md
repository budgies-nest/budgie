# Werewolf NPC

## Name and Title
**Name**: Thorne Blackwood  
**Title**: Alpha of the Shadow Creek Pack

## Age
**Age**: 27 (in human form), but 117 (werewolf form)

## Family
Thorne Blackwood is the only known living son of the former Alpha, Ewen Blackwood, who was killed during a skirmish with another werewolf pack. Thorne has a younger sister, Lyra, who is a human and unaware of her brother's true nature. Their mother, Elowen, is still alive and struggles to keep her sanity after the loss of her husband.

## Occupation
**Occupation**: Hunter and Protector  
Thorne serves as the leader of the Shadow Creek Pack, a small but fierce group of werewolves in the dense forests of the Blackwood estate. He is responsible for keeping his pack safe from both human and supernatural threats. Thorne is also a skilled tracker and huntsman, often assisting local farmers in dealing with dangerous beasts.

## Physical Appearance
Thorne stands at 6'2" with a broad, muscular build that speaks of years of training and combat. His hair, usually tied back in a loose braid, is a chestnut brown that is often matted with dirt and blood. His eyes, a piercing emerald green, glow with an otherworldly intensity when the moon is full. His skin is rugged and weathered, scarred from countless battles with both beasts and men. He has a large, crescent-shaped mark on his right cheek, a symbol of his rank and a memento from a battle with a particularly fierce werewolf.

## Clothing
Thorne wears a tattered, leather tunic and trousers that are practical and made for movement. He carries a broadsword at his hip and a hunting knife on his belt. In winter, he dons a heavy, fur-lined cloak that doubles as a makeshift blanket during his transformations. His boots are thick-soled and reinforced for walking through the forest.

## Food Preferences
Thorne has a particular fondness for roasted rabbit, which he always requests with a side of honey. He believes the sweetness of the honey balances out the gamey flavor of the meat, a preference that sets him apart from his packmates who prefer the raw flesh of prey.

## Background Story
Thorne grew up in the shadow of the Blackwood estate, where his father served as the Alpha of the Shadow Creek Pack. When his father was killed in a surprise attack by another pack, Thorne was forced to take over as Alpha at the tender age of 17. His first year as leader was a harrowing experience, marked by numerous skirmishes and the loss of several pack members. Despite the challenges, Thorne became stronger and wiser, learning the harsh realities of werewolf life and the importance of unity and strength.

Thorne's primary goal is to protect his pack and ensure their survival. He seeks to expand the territory of the Shadow Creek Pack and strengthen alliances with neighboring packs to prevent future attacks. His biggest fear is that the darkness within him will consume him, driving him to acts of violence and madness during his transformations.

## Personality and Character Traits
**Strengths**: Leadership, resilience, loyalty, strategic thinking, fearlessness  
**Weaknesses**: Impulsive, haunted by his past, struggles with the burden of responsibility  
**Distinctive Traits**: Thorne is known for his unwavering dedication to his pack and his fierce loyalty, even in the face of adversity. He is often seen as a symbol of strength and hope within the pack, but his inner turmoil is a closely guarded secret.
