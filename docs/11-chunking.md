## Chunking text

### Chunking text with overlap

```go
content := "# Star Trek: The Original Series"

chunks := rag.ChunkText(content, 10, 5)

fmt.Println("Chunks:")
for i, chunk := range chunks {
    fmt.Printf("Chunk %d: %s\n", i+1, chunk)
}
fmt.Println("Number of Chunks:", len(chunks))
```

**Output**:
```raw
Chunks:
Chunk 1: # Star Tre
Chunk 2: r Trek: Th
Chunk 3: k: The Ori
Chunk 4: e Original
Chunk 5: ginal Seri
Chunk 6:  Series
Chunk 7: es
Number of Chunks: 7
```

### Chunking text with delimiter

```go
content := "# Star Trek: The Original Series"

chunks := rag.SplitTextWithDelimiter(content, " ")

fmt.Println("Chunks:")
for i, chunk := range chunks {
    fmt.Printf("Chunk %d: %s\n", i+1, chunk)
}
fmt.Println("Number of Chunks:", len(chunks))
```

**Output**:
```raw
Chunks:
Chunk 1: #
Chunk 2: Star
Chunk 3: Trek:
Chunk 4: The
Chunk 5: Original
Chunk 6: Series
Number of Chunks: 6
```
